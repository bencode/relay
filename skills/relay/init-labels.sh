# Create-only: relay depends on the label NAMES (plus colors for consistency).
# Descriptions are cosmetic and project-local, so this script never overwrites an
# existing label — re-running it leaves labels you already have (e.g. ones with
# localized/translated descriptions) completely untouched.
